# Troubleshooting: Tailwind CSS Unknown Utility Class

## Problem

During the build process, an error was encountered:

```
[plugin:vite:css] [postcss] tailwindcss: /Users/1102680/ws/gemini-cli/ML-hub/src/index.css:1:1: Cannot apply unknown utility class `focus:ring-opacity-50`
```

This error indicated that the Tailwind CSS utility class `focus:ring-opacity-50` was not recognized by the PostCSS/Tailwind CSS compilation process.

## Cause

The `focus:ring-opacity-50` utility is related to Tailwind CSS's ring utilities, which are typically enabled by default or through plugins like `@tailwindcss/forms` or `@tailwindcss/typography`. Although `@tailwindcss/typography` was installed and configured, the specific `ring-opacity` variant was not being correctly processed or recognized by the Tailwind CSS setup in the project.

This could be due to several reasons, including:
*   A version incompatibility between Tailwind CSS and its plugins.
*   An incomplete or incorrect configuration of Tailwind CSS where certain core utilities or variants are not properly enabled.
*   A caching issue with the build tools.

## Solution

The immediate solution to resolve the build error was to remove the problematic utility class `focus:ring-opacity-50` from the CSS.

**File:** `src/index.css`

**Change:**
```css
/* Before */
.copy-button {
  @apply absolute top-2 right-2 bg-gray-700 text-gray-200 px-3 py-1 rounded-md text-xs font-semibold hover:bg-gray-600 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:ring-opacity-50;
}

/* After */
.copy-button {
  @apply absolute top-2 right-2 bg-gray-700 text-gray-200 px-3 py-1 rounded-md text-xs font-semibold hover:bg-gray-600 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500;
}
```

By removing `focus:ring-opacity-50`, the build process no longer encountered an unknown utility class, allowing the application to compile successfully.

### Further Investigation (if needed)

If `ring-opacity` functionality is critical, further investigation would involve:
*   Verifying the exact versions of `tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/postcss`, and `@tailwindcss/typography`.
*   Checking the `tailwind.config.js` for any custom theme extensions or plugin configurations that might inadvertently disable or interfere with core utilities.
*   Consulting the official Tailwind CSS documentation for the specific version being used regarding `ring` utilities and their variants.
